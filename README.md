This program is The Hangman Game. 
The user must try and guess the word one letter at a time.
The user loses a life every time they guess a letter not in the word.
There are a total of 6 lives. 

First the program displays an underscore for every letter, e.g. for cat _ _ _.
There's a prompt for the user to choose their first letter.

For every wrong letter the user completes the image of the hung man. The progress is displayed as well as an indication of how many lives remain.

Once the user chooses the correct letter, no life is lost, and they can continue on to the next letter with the correctly guessed letter displayed in its location within the word. 
e.g. user guesses 'a'. What's displayed is: -a-, followed by a prompt for the next guess.

If the user guesses the word, they win and the game terminates.
If they loose all lives before the game finishes, they build the hung man, lose the game, and the correct world is revealed. The game then terminates. 

This game is one of the projects from the Udemy course: 100 Days Of Python Programming with Angela Yu.
